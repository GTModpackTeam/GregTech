        "§oYour first §mbig§r§o Project! This one is for Steel!§r\n\nThe §3Primitive Blast Furnace§r (§3PBF§r) is an inherently §5B A L A N C E D§r multiblock. If you do not have a §3Macerator§r yet, this multiblock will be §lfour times as expensive§r.\nUsing the §3Macerator§r, you will need §d132 Clay§r, split into §d66 Clay Dusts§r and §d66 Brick Dusts§r.\n\nBuild the structure using §4JEI preview§r.\n\nAs for the Steel recipe, you will be rewarded if you used the §3Coke Oven§r earlier, as each Steel Ingot only requires §aone Coke§r instead of §atwo Coal§r. Otherwise, you can simply use §aCharcoal§r as it is mostly free.\nUsing §aWrought Iron§r cuts the recipe duration significantly... if you have the sanity to smelt thousands of nuggets beforehand.\n\n\nSteel will be §9extremely important throughout the entire game§r, make a lot of it!\nSteel also has §6double the durability§r compared to regular Iron for GregTech tools. It also provides §6Diamond mining level§r."
