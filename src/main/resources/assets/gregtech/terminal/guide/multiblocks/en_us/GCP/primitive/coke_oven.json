        "§oThis will be the first Project, or will it be?§r\n\nThe §3Coke Oven§r makes §aCoke from Coal§r, or §aCharcoal from Wood§r, in addition to §eCreosote§r as bonus§r output.\n§eCreosote§r can be used as furnace fuel to§6 smelt 32 items§r, and is required for making §dTreated Wood Planks§r (rings a bell?).\n\nMaking this Multiblock requires a total of §a117 Clay Balls§r and§a 195 Sand§r. The Wooden Form is not consumed.\nCheck the §2JEI Multiblock Preview§r for the structure pattern.\n\n§9Note:§r §lAny§r Brick block can be replaced with a §3Coke Oven Hatch§r. You can have up to five of them.\nThe Hatch allows for automation. It will §dauto-export§r Creosote into connected fluid containers, and it will also accept item insertion/extraction (you can use Hoppers).\n\nIf the Coke Oven happens to fully fill up on Creosote that you are not using, break and replace the Coke Oven block. Automated fluid voiding is available later in the game.\n\n\n§bLore:§r The concept of Multiblocks is very old in modded Minecraft. Think of IndustrialCraft 2\u0027s Nuclear Reactor, or Railcraft\u0027s Coke Oven; they were revolutionary at the time."
