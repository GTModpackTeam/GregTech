        "§oVacuums actually make things hotter... No questions asked.§r\n\nThe §3Vacuum Freezer§r is a multiblock used to cool down §eHot Ingots§r. All ingots made in the EBF with a temperature above §d1750K§r will need it.\n\nMost of the time, your §3Electric Blast Furnace§r will be the bottleneck, so you don\u0027t need to worry about overclocking your freezer.\n\nSince §eHot Ingots§r §churt you§r when held, item routing will be very useful.
