Not me, not you!\n\nTheir durability wears down really fast, so you may want to make them out of Diamond (but not the vanilla diamond Axe, no!).\n\nTake these spruce saplings to grow 2x2 giant trees. There\u0027s a lot of smelting coming up, and wooden planks are a surprisingly very effective fuel source.\n\n\n§eNote:§r Any Quest with GregTech tools can be completed with the tool crafted from any material, not just the one displayed.§r"
