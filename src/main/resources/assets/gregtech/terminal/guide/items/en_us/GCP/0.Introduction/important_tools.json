        "More GregTech tools are required for progression, here are the most important of them all.\n\n§9§lWrench:§r A crafting tool. But also a mining tool for GregTech machines (perfect if you think using pickaxes is unethical). Is that it? Certainly not! It has right click functions to double as a Forge §6Wrench for other mods§r. Right Click also allows you to set the output side of GregTech machines. Shift right clicking allows you to rotate GregTech machines.\n\n§9§lFile:§r A crafting tool. And that\u0027s it. Yes.\n\n§9§lSaw:§r Another crafting tool. If we were evil, we would force it to obtain 4 Planks and 4 Sticks from their respective crafting recipes. That said you can still use it to get §a6 Planks per Log§r, if you wish.\n\n\n§eNote:§r Any Quest with GregTech tools can be completed with the tool crafted from any material, not just the one displayed."
