        "More tools, not important right now, but required later on.\n\n§9§lScrewdriver:§r A crafting tool. It is used for special configuration of machines and Covers.\n\n§9§lWire Cutter:§r A crafting tool. It is needed to connect wires together. Right-clicking on wires will enable or disable connection to other blocks.\n\n§9§lMortar:§r A crafting tool, to grind various things into dust form.\n\n§9§lKnife:§r A mediocre weapon, but also... you guessed it, a crafting tool!\n\n§9§lSoft Mallet:§r A tool to pause machines from working with right-click. Right-clicking again resumes working.\n\nThere are a few §dother Tools§r which are less important, but deserve a mention.\n\n§9§lCrowbar:§r A niche tool to remove Covers from GregTech machines with a right-click.\n\n§9§lSense:§r A powerful farming tool, automatically breaks and re-plants crops in a large area.\n\n§9§lPlunger:§r A tool to clear stuck fluids from GregTech machines.\n\n§9§lButchery Knife:§r A weapon pre-enchanted with Looting III. Useful for getting extra food, Leather...\n\n§9§lBranch Cutter:§r It could be a crafting tool, but nothing uses it by default. So they\u0027re just fancy Shears.\n\n§9§lTurbine Rotor:§r Technically a tool, used in Large Turbines. Different materials grant different bonuses to power and efficiency.\n\n§eNote:§r Any Quest with GregTech tools can be completed with the tool crafted from any material, not just the one displayed."
