        "§o250 Million EU in a Battery, 25Min of Power when drained constantly!? That\u0027s amazing!§r\n\nThe §aLapotronic Energy Orb§r should be the beginning of the end of your energy storage struggles.\nThis Energy Storage is perfectly suited if your Power Generation is inconsistent, or if you need to buffer large amounts due to the nature of §3Large Turbines§r.\n\nIt does not come quite cheap though.
