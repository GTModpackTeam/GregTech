        "§oThe Forge Hammer hammers... That\u0027s fascinating!§r\n\nA lot of recipes are the same as your hand crafting recipes using a §5Hammer§r, but instead uses this machine!\n\nIt can process §aCobblestone in Gravel§r, and §aGravel into Sand§r. And it\u0027s fast at that too!\n\nLast but not least, it makes Plates at a better ratio: §6three Ingots for two Plates§r. A worthwhile investment!\n\n\nYou know what? Bonus! Get an anvil back from crafting it. This is a small reminder that you can repair GregTech tools using an Anvil."
