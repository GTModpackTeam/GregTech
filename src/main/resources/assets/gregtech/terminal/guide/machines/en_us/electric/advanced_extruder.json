        "§oI hope at no point you made the LV Extruder, because only the MV Extruder is actually useful. If you did, I suggest you recycle it through the Arc Furnace.§r\n\nThe Extruder shapes solid materials into (almost!) any form using §aIngots§r. This is a great way to reduce the amount of microcrafting, as well as keeping a high conversion ratio.\n\nThe Extruder can make §6Bolts§r, §6Small Gears§r, §6Gears§r, and §6Rings§r at the highest efficiency in a single step!\nYou may also like to use it for §dPipes§r, §dLong Rods§r, and §dRotors§r."
