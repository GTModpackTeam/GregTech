That would be nice if the questbook designer gave one for free, wouldn\u0027t it?\n\nYou can right click the Programmed Circuit in your hand or within the machine\u0027s §aConfiguration Slot§r to change the configuration number. Note that at the time of writing, this slot is §cnot detected§r for recipes!"
